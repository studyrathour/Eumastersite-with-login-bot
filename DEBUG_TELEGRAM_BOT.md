# Telegram Bot Debugging Guide

## Current Issue

The Telegram bot service is still failing to start properly, with the process exiting immediately with status 1. This indicates that there's an error occurring during the startup process.

## Potential Causes

1. **Missing BOT_TOKEN environment variable**
2. **Python dependencies not properly installed**
3. **Issues with the Telegram bot token**
4. **Network connectivity issues**
5. **Permission issues with the nobody user**

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Environment Variables

Ensure that the BOT_TOKEN environment variable is properly set in the Koyeb application settings.

### 2. Verify Python Dependencies

The Dockerfile should properly install all required dependencies. Check that the requirements.txt file is being processed correctly.

### 3. Add More Detailed Logging

The updated bot.py file now includes more detailed logging and error reporting to help identify the specific issue.

### 4. Test Locally

To test locally, you can run:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t edumaster-test .

# Run with environment variables
docker run -p 80:80 -p 8000:8000 -e BOT_TOKEN=your_actual_bot_token_here edumaster-test
```

### 5. Check Specific Error Messages

Look for specific error messages in the supervisord logs:
- `/var/log/supervisor/telegram-bot.log`
- `/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log`

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Logging**: Added more detailed logging and print statements to identify where the failure occurs
2. **Better Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks with detailed error reporting
3. **Early Exit Detection**: Added sys.exit(1) when critical dependencies are missing
4. **Supervisord Configuration**: Added `-u` flag to python command for unbuffered output

## Expected Improvements

With these changes, you should now see more detailed error messages in the logs that will help identify the specific cause of the startup failure.

## If Issues Persist

1. Check the supervisor logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that the BOT_TOKEN environment variable is correctly set and valid
3. Ensure all Python dependencies are properly installed in the Docker container
4. Test the Docker image locally before deploying to Koyeb
5. Consider temporarily changing the user from "nobody" to "root" in supervisord.conf to rule out permission issues

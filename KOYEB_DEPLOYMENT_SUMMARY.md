## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)
- Connect your GitHub repository to Koyeb
- Koyeb will automatically build and deploy your application
- Future updates are automatically deployed when you push to GitHub

### Method 2: Manual Upload
- Build the project locally with `npm run build`
- Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to Koyeb

## Project Structure for Deployment

The built project in the `dist` folder contains:
- `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `assets/`: Folder with CSS and JavaScript bundles
- All static assets needed for the application

## Token Authentication System

The EduMaster platform includes a token-based authentication system that:
- Integrates with a Telegram bot for token verification
- Grants 24-hour access upon successful verification
- Protects all content behind authentication
- Shows access expiration countdown

## Environment Configuration

The application is configured to work in both development and production environments:
- Uses direct API calls to the Telegram bot backend
- Handles CORS properly for cross-origin requests
- Includes error handling for network issues

# Persistent Issue Resolutions

This document summarizes all the changes made to resolve the persistent nginx deployment issues on Koyeb.

## Issues Identified

1. **Nginx Configuration Dependencies**: The nginx.conf file was trying to include external files that may not exist in the container environment.
2. **Supervisord Configuration**: The nginx command was not running in foreground mode as required by supervisord.
3. **Health Check Failures**: Port 8000 was not properly exposed in koyeb.yaml.
4. **Environment Variable Handling**: The BOT_TOKEN was hardcoded in supervisord.conf instead of being dynamically referenced.
5. **Missing Error Handling**: Limited logging and error handling in the Telegram bot API.

## Changes Made

### 1. nginx.conf Improvements

**File**: [nginx.conf](file:///c%3A/Users/suraj/Downloads/edumaster40-main/nginx.conf)

**Changes**:
- Embedded MIME types directly instead of including `/etc/nginx/mime.types`
- Removed the problematic `include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;` directive
- Added a `/health` endpoint for easier health checking
- Made the configuration more self-contained

### 2. supervisord.conf Improvements

**File**: [supervisord.conf](file:///c%3A/Users/suraj/Downloads/edumaster40-main/supervisord.conf)

**Changes**:
- Changed nginx command to `nginx -g 'daemon off;'` for proper foreground operation
- Updated environment variable reference to use `%(ENV_BOT_TOKEN)s` for dynamic token handling
- Added `startretries=3` to allow for restart attempts
- Improved error handling configuration

### 3. koyeb.yaml Improvements

**File**: [koyeb.yaml](file:///c%3A/Users/suraj/Downloads/edumaster40-main/koyeb.yaml)

**Changes**:
- Added port 8000 to the ports configuration to expose the Telegram bot API
- Ensured both ports 80 and 8000 are properly configured

### 4. Telegram Bot API Improvements

**File**: [telegram_bot/api.py](file:///c%3A/Users/suraj/Downloads/edumaster40-main/telegram_bot/api.py)

**Changes**:
- Added proper logging configuration
- Enhanced error handling with try-catch blocks
- Added logging for all endpoints
- Improved startup logging
- Added check for missing BOT_TOKEN with warning message

### 5. New Documentation and Tools

**Files Created**:
- [KOYEB_DETAILED_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](file:///c%3A/Users/suraj/Downloads/edumaster40-main/KOYEB_DETAILED_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - Detailed troubleshooting guide
- [test-nginx-config.sh](file:///c%3A/Users/suraj/Downloads/edumaster40-main/test-nginx-config.sh) - Script to test nginx configuration

## Expected Results

With these changes, the following issues should be resolved:

1. **Nginx Startup**: Nginx should now start properly in supervisord without exiting immediately
2. **Health Checks**: Both ports 80 and 8000 should pass health checks
3. **Environment Variables**: BOT_TOKEN will be properly passed from the deployment environment
4. **Error Handling**: Better logging and error handling will help identify any remaining issues
5. **Configuration Validation**: Self-contained nginx configuration eliminates external dependencies

## Deployment Verification Steps

1. **Check Logs**: After deployment, check the supervisord, nginx, and Telegram bot logs for any errors
2. **Test Endpoints**: 
   - Nginx health check: `curl http://your-app.koyeb.app/health`
   - Bot health check: `curl http://your-app.koyeb.app/api/health`
3. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure BOT_TOKEN is set in the Koyeb application settings
4. **Monitor Restart Loops**: Verify that nginx and the Telegram bot are not constantly restarting

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Make sure to set BOT_TOKEN in your Koyeb application environment variables
2. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check the application logs for any error messages
3. **Test Locally**: Before deploying, test the Docker image locally to catch configuration issues early
4. **Use Health Checks**: Implement comprehensive health checks to quickly identify issues

These changes address the root causes of the persistent nginx deployment issues and should result in a stable deployment on Koyeb.

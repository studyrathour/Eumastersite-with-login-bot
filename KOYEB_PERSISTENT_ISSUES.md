# Fixing Persistent Koyeb Deployment Issues

This guide addresses persistent "Cannot GET" errors and other deployment issues when deploying EduMaster to Koyeb.

## üéØ Root Cause Analysis

The persistent "Cannot GET" error is typically caused by one or more of these issues:

1. **Incorrect routing configuration** in koyeb.yaml and koyeb.toml
2. **Missing or incorrect dist folder** in deployment
3. **Wrong .koyebignore configuration** excluding necessary files
4. **Asset path issues** in built HTML files
5. **Koyeb service configuration** not properly set up

## üîß Comprehensive Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed koyeb.yaml Routing
```yaml
routes:
  - path: "/"
    dest: "/index.html"  # Root path explicitly points to index.html
  - path: "/*"
    dest: "/index.html"  # All other paths also point to index.html
```

### 2. Enhanced koyeb.toml Redirects
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### 3. Updated Vite Configuration
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  base: './',  // Relative paths for assets
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: undefined,
        entryFileNames: `[name].js`,
        chunkFileNames: `[name].js`,
        assetFileNames: `[name].[ext]`
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### 4. Fixed .koyebignore
Removed `dist/` from the ignore file to ensure built files are deployed.

## üìã Files Modified

1. **koyeb.yaml** - Corrected routing configuration
2. **koyeb.toml** - Enhanced redirect rules and CORS headers
3. **vite.config.ts** - Updated base path and build configuration
4. **.koyebignore** - Removed dist/ to include built files

## üöÄ Redeployment Process

### For GitHub Integration:
1. Push all changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix persistent Koyeb deployment issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Wait for Koyeb to automatically deploy the changes

### For Manual Deployment:
1. Rebuild the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to Koyeb

## üîç Verification Checklist

After redeployment:
- [ ] Wait 3-5 minutes for Koyeb to process changes
- [ ] Visit your root URL (e.g., https://your-app.koyeb.app/)
- [ ] Test direct navigation to /admin
- [ ] Test direct navigation to /batches
- [ ] Verify token authentication works
- [ ] Check browser console for errors

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Troubleshooting

### 1. Check Koyeb Dashboard
- Verify deployment logs show successful build
- Confirm service status is "Healthy"
- Check that the correct files were deployed

### 2. Test Locally
- Run `npm run preview` to test the built version
- Verify routing works in local preview
- Check that all assets load correctly

### 3. Inspect Deployed Files
- Check that index.html exists in the root
- Verify that CSS and JS files are in the root (not in assets folder)
- Confirm asset paths in index.html use relative paths (./)

### 4. Koyeb Service Configuration
- Ensure service type is set to "static"
- Verify port is set to 80
- Confirm region is correctly set

## üìû Emergency Solutions

If the issue persists:

### Option 1: Simplified Configuration
1. Create a minimal koyeb.yaml:
   ```yaml
   name: edumaster
   service_type: static
   ```

2. Remove koyeb.toml temporarily

3. Redeploy

### Option 2: Manual File Structure
1. Ensure dist folder contains:
   - index.html
   - index.js
   - index.css
   - protection.js
   - sw.js

2. Upload these files directly to Koyeb

### Option 3: Contact Support
- Provide deployment logs
- Include error screenshots
- Mention all configuration files

## üéâ Expected Outcome

After applying these fixes and redeploying, your EduMaster application should:
- Load the main page without "Cannot GET" errors
- Handle all client-side routes properly
- Maintain all functionality including token authentication
- Work correctly with direct URL navigation

The comprehensive fixes ensure that:
1. Koyeb properly routes all requests to index.html
2. Assets are correctly referenced with relative paths
3. All necessary files are included in the deployment
4. CORS is properly configured for API calls

This should resolve the persistent "Cannot GET" error and make your application fully functional on Koyeb.

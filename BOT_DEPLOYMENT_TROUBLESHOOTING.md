# Bot Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status

The Telegram bot is still failing to start properly in the Koyeb deployment. The process starts but immediately exits with status 1.

## Detailed Analysis

Looking at the logs, the issue appears to be that the Telegram bot process is not starting correctly. This could be due to several factors:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: The Python dependencies might not be properly installed
2. **Incorrect File Paths**: The bot files might not be in the expected location
3. **Environment Variables**: The BOT_TOKEN might not be set or accessible
4. **Permission Issues**: The nobody user might not have proper permissions

## Enhanced Debugging Steps

### 1. Check File Structure in Container

Add a verification step to the deployment to check if files are in the correct location:

```bash
# Add this to supervisord.conf as a one-time check
[program:verify-bot-files]
command=python /app/verify_bot_files.py
autostart=true
autorestart=false
stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/verify-bot-files.log
stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/verify-bot-files.log
priority=5
```

### 2. Add More Detailed Error Reporting

The updated bot.py file now includes:
- More detailed logging
- Better error handling
- Early exit detection
- Print statements for immediate feedback

### 3. Check Environment Variables

Add a check to verify that BOT_TOKEN is set:

```python
# In bot.py main function
token = os.environ.get('BOT_TOKEN')
if not token:
    print("CRITICAL ERROR: BOT_TOKEN environment variable not set")
    logger.error("CRITICAL ERROR: BOT_TOKEN environment variable not set")
    sys.exit(1)
else:
    print(f"BOT_TOKEN is set (length: {len(token)})")
```

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Dockerfile**: Added file permissions and verification script
2. **Updated supervisord.conf**: Added -u flag for unbuffered output
3. **Improved bot.py**: Added comprehensive error handling and logging
4. **Added Verification Script**: Created verify_bot_files.py to check file structure

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy with Enhanced Debugging**: Redeploy with the new changes
2. **Check Verification Logs**: Look at the verify-bot-files.log for file structure issues
3. **Examine Telegram Bot Logs**: Check telegram-bot.log for specific error messages
4. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure BOT_TOKEN is properly set in Koyeb

## If Issues Persist

1. Temporarily change the user from "nobody" to "root" in supervisord.conf
2. Add a simple test program to verify Python and dependencies
3. Check if the issue is specific to the Telegram bot library
4. Consider using a different approach to start the bot (e.g., a shell script wrapper)

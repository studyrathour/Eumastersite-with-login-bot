# Nginx and Deployment Issues Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Nginx Configuration Issue**: The nginx process was failing to start properly in the supervisord configuration.
2. **Missing Port Configuration**: The koyeb.yaml file was missing port 8000 configuration for the Telegram bot API.
3. **Nginx Include Directive**: The nginx.conf had an include directive for `/etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf` which might not exist in the container.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed supervisord.conf
- Changed the nginx command from `nginx` to `nginx -g 'daemon off;'` for proper supervision
- Added better error handling for the Telegram bot program

### 2. Updated koyeb.yaml
- Added port 8000 to the ports configuration to expose the Telegram bot API

### 3. Modified nginx.conf
- Removed the `include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;` line that was causing nginx to fail

## Additional Improvements

### Enhanced supervisord.conf for Telegram Bot
- Added `redirect_stderr=true` to capture all output in one log file
- Added `stopwaitsecs=10` to give the bot time to shut down gracefully

## Verification Steps

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t edumaster .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 80:80 -p 8000:8000 edumaster
   ```

3. Check the logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs <container_id>
   ```

## Expected Outcome

With these fixes, the nginx process should start properly and remain running, and the health checks on both ports 80 and 8000 should pass successfully.

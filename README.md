## Security Features

### Content Protection
- **Base64 Encoding**: All content titles and URLs are encoded using Base64 with random prefixes/suffixes to prevent web scraping
- **Dynamic Obfuscation**: Content attributes are dynamically obfuscated in the DOM to prevent extension detection
- **Secure Storage**: Sensitive data is encoded before storage in Firebase and decoded when retrieved
- **Anti-Scraping**: Multiple layers of protection against automated content extraction

### How It Works
1. Content titles and URLs are encoded with Base64 plus random strings when stored
2. Data is decoded only when needed for display to legitimate users
3. DOM attributes are continuously obfuscated to prevent inspection
4. Web scraper extensions cannot easily extract the actual content information

### Usage
The security system works automatically - no manual intervention needed. Content is:
- Automatically encoded when created/imported
- Safely stored in encoded format
- Properly decoded for display
- Protected from common scraping techniques

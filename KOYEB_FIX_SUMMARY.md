# Koyeb Deployment Fix Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to fix the "No active service" error when deploying EduMaster to Koyeb.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Identified

The "No active service" error was caused by incorrect Koyeb configuration files that didn't properly define the static site service.

## ðŸ”§ Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed koyeb.yaml Configuration
**Before**:
```yaml
# Koyeb configuration file for static site deployment
name: edumaster
type: static
env:
  - key: NODE_ENV
    value: production
routes:
  - path: /*
    app: edumaster
ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: http
regions:
  - was
```

**After**:
```yaml
# Koyeb configuration file for static site deployment
name: edumaster
service_type: static
routes:
  - path: "/*"
    dest: "/"
ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: http
regions:
  - was
```

### 2. Added koyeb.toml Configuration
Created a new configuration file with proper SPA routing:
```toml
# This configuration file tells Koyeb how to build and deploy your site.

[build]
  # The command to build your site.
  command = "npm install && npm run build"
  # The directory that contains the built site.
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  # This sets the Node.js version for Koyeb.
  NODE_VERSION = "20"

# This rule is essential for Single Page Applications (SPAs) like yours.
# It ensures that all paths are handled by your index.html file,
# fixing "404 Not Found" errors on direct navigation to routes.
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

# Add CORS headers for API calls
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*"
```

### 3. Updated package.json
Added a specific build command for Koyeb:
```json
"build:koyeb": "vite build"
```

### 4. Added Comprehensive Documentation
- **KOYEB_TROUBLESHOOTING.md**: Detailed troubleshooting guide
- **KOYEB_FIX_CHECKLIST.md**: Step-by-step fix checklist

## ðŸ“ž Support Resources

If you continue to experience issues:
1. **Check Build Logs** in Koyeb dashboard
2. **Review** KOYEB_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
3. **Follow** KOYEB_FIX_CHECKLIST.md
4. **Contact** Koyeb support

## ðŸŽ‰ Expected Outcome

After redeploying with these fixes, your EduMaster application should be accessible without the "No active service" error. The configuration changes ensure that:

1. Koyeb properly recognizes your app as a static site service
2. All routes are correctly handled for the SPA
3. Assets are served properly
4. CORS is configured for API calls

The fix addresses the root cause of the "No active service" error by providing Koyeb with the correct configuration for deploying a React SPA.
